This is one of the most basic game feature in Valorant and hence I would start this feature first.

The player can choose from a set of agents and a timer of 60 seconds start. No 2 player can have the same agent. So the first player to lock in gets the agent . If the player have selected an agent but haven’t locked in the timer will reach till 0 seconds and then the game will start. If any of the player didn’t select the agent the match will be over.
